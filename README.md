# DATA_VISUALIZATION
Data Visualization on Exchange Rates. 

This project is about analysing the exchange rate between the euro and the American dollar.

Before creating data visualizations, first always need to clean the data.

Below are some cleaning process:

We rename the columns to something easier to type â€” US_dollar and Time.

We change the Time column to a datetime data type.

We sort the values by Time in ascending order.

We reset the index (and drop the initial index).

In DATA VISUALIZATION process:

Generate a line plot to visualize the evolution of the euro-dollar exchange rate.

Plotting moving average for each country currency rate to see a long term trend.
